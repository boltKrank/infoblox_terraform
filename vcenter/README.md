vsphere_user = ""

vsphere_password = ""

vsphere_server = ""

v_datacenter = ""

v_datastore = ""

v_network = ""

vm_name = ""

v_resource_pool = ""

v_cpu_count =   //number

v_memory_count =  //number

v_os_guest_type = "" 

v_disk_size =  //number

v_host = ""

vm_template_name = ""
